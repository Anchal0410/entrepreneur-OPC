# Apify Integration Web Application

A full-stack web application that demonstrates integration with the Apify platform, allowing users to authenticate, select actors, view their schemas, and execute them with real-time results.

## ðŸš€ How to Install and Run Your Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Apify API key from [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd apify-integration-app
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`

5. **Start the Frontend Application**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

6. **Open Your Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to use the application

## ðŸŽ¯ Which Actor You Chose for Testing

**Primary Test Actor: Website Content Crawler (`apify/website-content-crawler`)**

This actor was chosen for testing because:
- It's a popular, well-maintained public actor from Apify
- Has a comprehensive input schema that demonstrates dynamic form generation
- Supports various configuration options (crawling settings, output formats, etc.)
- Provides good examples of required and optional fields
- Works with simple URL inputs for easy testing

**Alternative Test Actors Available:**
- Web Scraper (`apify/web-scraper`)
- Google Search Results Scraper (`apify/google-search-results-scraper`)
- Instagram Scraper (`apify/instagram-scraper`)

## ðŸŽ¨ Any Assumptions or Notable Design Choices You Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **React + Vite Frontend**: Chosen for fast development and modern tooling
- **Node.js + Express Backend**: Provides secure API key handling and clean REST endpoints
- **No Database**: Application is stateless and doesn't persist data beyond the session
- **Memory Storage Only**: API keys stored in browser localStorage (not in backend)

### Technical Assumptions
- **Public Actor Fallback**: If users have no personal actors, the app shows popular public actors for testing
- **Actor-Specific Logic**: Special handling for different actor types (Web Scraper vs Website Content Crawler)
- **Schema-Driven Forms**: Dynamic form generation based on actor input schemas
- **URL Format Detection**: Automatically formats startUrls based on actor requirements

### Design Choices
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, visually appealing design with backdrop blur effects
- **Step-by-Step Flow**: Clear progression from authentication â†’ actor selection â†’ configuration â†’ execution
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatic polling for running actor status
- **Error-First Design**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Security & Best Practices
- **Server-Side API Calls**: All Apify API requests go through backend to protect API keys
- **Input Validation**: Both client-side and server-side validation
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout the application
- **Clean Code Structure**: Modular components and services for maintainability

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots or Brief Notes Demonstrating the Working Flow

### 1. Authentication Screen
- User enters their Apify API key
- Real-time validation with the Apify API
- Clear error messages for invalid keys

### 2. Actor Selection
- Displays available actors (user's own + popular public actors)
- Search functionality to filter actors
- Actor cards show descriptions and statistics

### 3. Schema Configuration
- Dynamic form generation based on actor input schema
- Special handling for different field types (URLs, arrays, objects, booleans)
- Required field validation
- Pre-filled default values for easy testing

### 4. Execution Results
- Real-time status updates (RUNNING â†’ SUCCEEDED/FAILED)
- Detailed execution statistics (compute units, memory usage, duration)
- Results display with JSON formatting
- Download functionality for results
- Error details for failed runs

### 5. Working Example Flow
```
1. Enter API key â†’ âœ… Authenticated as "fulfilling_flight"
2. Select "Website Content Crawler" â†’ âœ… Schema loaded
3. Configure startUrls: ["https://example.com"] â†’ âœ… Form validated
4. Execute actor â†’ âœ… Run started (ID: SGuFn0s6n0YpYYsRl)
5. Status updates â†’ âœ… RUNNING â†’ FAILED (normal for many websites)
6. View detailed stats â†’ âœ… 15.4s runtime, 0.002 compute units
```
